<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of rrplot is to provide auditors at OAG Norway with the
ability to quickly make beautiful graphs with ggplot2 that are in
accordance with official requirements.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rrplot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Riksrevisjonen/rrplot")
```

## Contents

### Main theme

Most of the adjustments to the graph aesthetics can be found in the
`theme_RR()` function. This is simply added as a layer in the ggplot
call.

### Custom wrappers for specific geoms

The package also contains custom wrappers for the following geom
functions in `ggplot2`:

- `geom_bar()` -\> `geom_bar_RR()`
- `geom_point()` -\> `geom_point_RR()`
- `geom_jitter()` -\> `geom_jitter_RR()`
- `geom_density()` -\> `geom_density_RR()`
- `geom_line()` -\> `geom_line_RR()`

These wrappers are also added as layers in the ggplot call, along with
`theme_RR()`. Note that `theme_RR()` needs to be placed **before** the
geom wrapper (see example below). Using the custom wrappers are
optional, but recommended.

### Color scales

The package contains functions to determine the color palette of your
graphs.

Discrete color palette functions:

- `scale_color_RR()`: Used when the **color** argument of `aes()` has
  been assigned.
- `scale_fill_RR()`: Used when the **fill** argument of `aes()` has been
  assigned.

These are added as separate layers in the ggplot call and contain 9
colors:

``` r
library(scales)
show_col(RR_pal()(9))
```

Continuous color palette functions:

- `scale_fill_continuous_RR_red`: Red continuous **fill** scale between
  `#FB749D` and `#B8002A`
- `scale_fill_continuous_RR_blue` Blue continuous **fill** scale between
  `#4CA4E6` and `#01123B`
- `scale_color_continuous_RR_red` Red continuous **color** scale between
  `#FB749D` and `#B8002A`
- `scale_color_continuous_RR_blue` Blue continuous **color** scale
  between `#4CA4E6` and `#01123B`

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a bar chart:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
# library(rrplot)

mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(cyl),
             fill = factor(am))) +
  theme_RR() +
  geom_bar_RR() +
  labs(title = "This is a bar chart",
       subtitle = "This is a more detailed description of the underlying data",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Category") +
  scale_fill_RR()
```

Note that `geom_bar_RR()` accepts the same arguments as `geom_bar()`.
Again, please note that `theme_RR()` needs to be placed **before** the
`geom_bar()` layer.

Another example, with a scatter plot:

``` r

iris |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length,
             y = Sepal.Width,
             color = Species)) +
  theme_RR() +
  geom_point_RR() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot",
       subtitle = "This is a longer text that spans across several lines,\nproviding more information to the reader.",
       x = "Sepal Length",
       y = "Sepal Width") +
  scale_color_RR()

```
